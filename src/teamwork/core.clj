  (comment This app we will use to practise our clojure modules with repository access
           Each person will create a new clojure file or namespace with code examples within this app
           each clj file must have a function called run_examples that conditionally or sequentially calls
           all other functions you created in your file to demonstrate the concept learnt.
           We will then commit and push our individual cljs to the repo and by friday evening we will
           try to run the main to see the results of each module .
           I have taken the liberty to assign to each of us the topics which we must be confident with to be
           ready for the clojure project.
           Vishal - macros, defprotocol and extend-type etc
           Arun   - file IO read write append, mapping say student name and class type atrributes from a file to a structure or map
           Varshita - concurrency and parallelism in programming clojure book
           Raja - Recursive function calls
           Shiva  - specs and validations
           Parul  - test driven development error handling

           please code your run_examples function to take one integer argument that we will pass to it from -main
           to selectively run our modules.
           Once all of us have checked in our code n github we can review each others work to learn .
